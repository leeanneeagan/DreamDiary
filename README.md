## 🧠 Core Logic
Users register and log in via Passport local strategy.
Once logged in, they can add messages to the shared board.
Messages are stored in MongoDB and rendered dynamically using EJS.
Users can like (☁️) or dislike (🌧️) dreams, or delete (🗑️) their own.
Logout clears the session, returning them to the login screen.

## 💻 Example
A typical dream entry looks like:
Name: leeanneeagan@example.com
Message: “Move to Paris and open a cozy coffee shop!”
Likes: ☁️☁️☁️

## 🌠 Future Enhancements
