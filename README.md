##  Core Logic
- Users register and log in via Passport local strategy.
- Once logged in, they can add messages to the shared board.
- Messages are stored in MongoDB and rendered dynamically using EJS.
- Users can like (☁️) or dislike (🌧️) dreams, or delete (🗑️) their own.
- Logout clears the session, returning them to the login screen.

---

##  Example
- A typical dream entry looks like:
- Name: leeanneeagan@example.com
- Message: “Move to Paris and open a cozy coffee shop!”
- Likes: ☁️☁️☁️

---

##  Future Enhancements
- User profile pages with uploaded dream images
- Category filters (career, travel, personal growth)
- Public/private dream toggles
- Notifications for dream “likes”
- Cloud-themed animations ☁️💭
